          <h3>Choosing the amperage</h3>
          <div class="tip">
            <p>Rule of thumb: When choosing a fuse that will be reliable in conditions of steady current consumption, a safe rule is to figure the maximum amperage when all components are functioning and add 50%.
              <br />
</p>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Exception</b> of that would be when current spikes are relevant in the design. Then the current surge of a duration <i>t</i> [s] of a fuse is given by the formula: \[I^2t = I^2 \cdot t\]
              <p>			  <b>Some semiconductors also have this rating (I2t) and should be protected with a similarly rated fuse</b>
                <br />
</p>
            </li>
            <li>For <i><b>resettable fuses</b></i> the maximum safe level of current is known as the <i>hold current</i> and the current that triggers its response is termed the <i>trip current</i></li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Choosing the voltage rating</h3>
          <p>		  
            <br />
</p>
          <div class="tip">
            <p>The voltage rating of a fuse is the maximum voltage at which its element can be counted on to melt in a safe and predictable manner when it is overloaded. <i>Also known as breaking capacity</i>. Above that, arc can form and sustain the electrical connection.
              <br />
</p>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>A fuse can always be used at a lower voltage than the rating.</li>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Time of delay</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Fuses may be fast acting, medium acting or slow-blowing. 
              <p>			  <b>None of the terms describing the speed of action of a fuse has been standardized with a specific time or time range, so design-driven datasheet inspection is needed.</b>

          <h3>Temperature dependence of current rating</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Non-resettable fuses are affected to the minor extent.</li>
            <li>Resettable fuses are highly sensitive to ambient temperature and should be kept at room temperature to sustain current ratings.</li>
            <li>Approximate idea of temperature sensitivity:
